# automateVaccineCheck

This is a program to automate my search for a covid19 vaccine. This will check through VaxMax and Costco.

In order to run the program, download the repository, ensure that all of the necessary libraries (see requirements.txt) are downloaded, fill in the secret.py file with the appropriate information, and run runFile.py

Still to do:

Check Costco aspect
Create tests
